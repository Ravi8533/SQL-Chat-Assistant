# SQL-Chat-Assistant
# Chat Assistant for SQLite

### **How the Assistant Works**

This is a chat assistant where the user gives a query in their own language, and the assistant converts it into an SQL query based on a certain pattern designed in the backend. The assistant also answers general questions in the user's language.

### **Steps to Run the Project Locally**

1. First, you need to run the `app.py` file in the terminal using the command: `python app.py`.
2. Once the `app.py` file runs, it will provide you with a link.
3. Go to the link, and the chat assistant will open.
4. Enter your query and click on the "Send" button.
5. The answer will appear in the chat box.

### **Known Limitations and Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Limitations**:  
  The main limitation of this chat assistant is that it can only handle basic questions. The assistant works based on a hardcoded pattern for certain types of queries. For now, it only uses the Flask framework for the UI.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  To make the assistant more effective, we could integrate AI models like LLaMA to enhance its ability to handle a wider range of questions. It would be more user-friendly if we used other APIs as well to improve its functionality.
